# MOVED TO Blue-Ocean-App

Blue Ocean is an IOS Game currently in development. It's founder and creator is Andrew Sheron.

The Goal of Blue Ocean is to raise awareness of the pollution in our oceans, shine a light on companies that are trying to 
fix the issue, and to, hopefully, get people to do something active about it. The game simulates the user taking actions to 
help clean our oceans. As the player progresses they will gain currencies to buy new boats, upgrade their items, and restore
our ocean to it's bright beautiful blue.
